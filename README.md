# guitarChordsPractice

This is a Python GUI application built using Tkinter that displays guitar chords at a specified tempo. Just a side project, open to improvements. I am looking to expand my guitar skills by practicing progression but I felt there isnt enough randomness in what I play spontaneously so I made this which displays different guitar chords randomly at a desired temp(I think my logic here is broken, but if you slide it through you get the jist of it.)
